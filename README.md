### Description
This respository holds our class project for CSC 3350 - Computer Game Design at [Florida Southern College](https://www.flsouthern.edu/) for the Spring 2024 semester. Our task was to design and implement our very own game using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) version 4.2.1. Idle Internet is an idle-clicker game with an Internet theme, where the player's objective is to earn currency to upgrade different components of a computer network. Alongside playing the game, players also have an opportunity to learn about the different areas of computer networking while they play the game by looking through our education section built into the game.
